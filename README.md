# AstroVAE
Data reduction, emulation and inference using a combination of GP emulator and Variational autoencoder 

## Architecture: 

![Model](Old/ArchitectureFullAE.png "Full model")

To Do:
0. Latin -> CAMB 

1. Added dropout
2. Deeper

3. t-SNE
4. RNN for time analysis

5. Deeper

6. Can add a little bit noise to data -- so that distribution itself is not learnt.
7. Use part of the data to predict the entire data well.?


7. Adversarial AEs

VAe -- can specify priors for latent distribution.
